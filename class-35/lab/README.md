# Module 7 Project: RESTy Conversion to Context and Hooks

We currently have a live RESTy application deployed at Netlify

For this project, you will build a similar application in this lab, covering most of the core features (details below).

The style and functionality as presented must be matched. You must use your own markup and CSS.

Treat the deployed application as a mockup/redline.

## Before you begin
Refer to *Getting Started*  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

## Getting Started

## Requirements
* Visit and review the deployed [RESTy Application](https://resty.netlify.com)
* Match the design and overall functionality
  * Input field for entering a URL
  * Radio Buttons for method (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE)
  * Input field for typing in JSON for POST/PUT
* Full Testing and Documentation are required.


## Stretch Goals
* Use authenticated APIs by sending either Basic or Bearer Auth, when specified
  * Username+Password entry for Basic Auth
  * Token entry for Bearer Auth
* Save History in local storage
  * When choosing from history, pre-fill the form


## Assignment Submission Instructions
Refer to the the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for the complete lab submission process and expectations

You are required to deploy a locally built application, using an "ejected" `create-react-app`
