# LAB - React Native - Milestone 2: Polish and Delivery

Continue to work on your phone application. Deploy to either Google Play or the Apple App Store.

## Before you begin
Refer to *Getting Started*  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

## Assignment Recap
Create your first Phone App. What it does and how it looks is up to you. 

### Application Requirements
* Use 2 screens
* Use and share state between components/screens
* Use at least 1 native device feature (contacts, camera, gps, etc)
* Properly Documented for End Users
* Live Demo

### Milestone 2 - Product Delivery (This Lab)
As you complete your RNA, switch your focus to the user experience.

* Quality and Thoughtful Styling using `css-in-js`
* Right sized tap targets, good contrast
* Dark and Light Modes
* Well thought through UX
  * Be considerate of individuals that primarily use their thumbs, left or right hands


### Stretch Goal

* Deploy to an app store!
* At minimum, you can do an "In Development" deployment, not publicly published


###  Delivery

In addition to the End User documentation noted in the app requirements, you will be presenting your application live to the class.

Prepare a good working demo, be ready to jump into code sample and answer questions related to "How the heck did you do that??"
